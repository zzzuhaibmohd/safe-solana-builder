## 1. ACCOUNT DESERIALIZATION & VALIDATION

In native Rust, there is no framework to catch you. Every check that Anchor does automatically, you do by hand. Miss one and you ship a vulnerability.

### 1.1 The Mandatory Validation Sequence
For every account passed into your instruction, perform all applicable checks in this order before touching any data:

```
1. Key check       — is this the account I expect (if fixed)?
2. Owner check     — does the right program own this account?
3. Signer check    — does this account need to have signed?
4. Writable check  — does this account need to be writable?
5. Discriminator   — does the data belong to the expected type?
6. Data validation — are fields within expected ranges?
```

Never skip steps. Never reorder them. Perform all applicable checks before proceeding.

### 1.2 Owner Check — The Most Commonly Missed
```rust
if account.owner != program_id {
    return Err(ProgramError::IncorrectProgramId);
}
```
- Check this before deserializing. Deserializing data from the wrong program is a type cosplay attack.
- For accounts owned by the System Program (e.g., user wallets): `account.owner == &system_program::ID`.
- For token accounts: `account.owner == &spl_token::ID` (or `spl_token_2022::ID`).

### 1.3 Signer Check
```rust
if !authority.is_signer {
    return Err(ProgramError::MissingRequiredSignature);
}
```
- Perform this for every account that represents an authority, admin, or user authorizing an action.
- Never assume a keypair account signed just because it's listed.

### 1.4 Discriminator / Type Check
- Native Rust accounts don't get automatic discriminators. You must manage them.
- Design pattern: reserve the first byte(s) of every account's data as a type tag.
```rust
const VAULT_DISCRIMINATOR: u8 = 1;
const USER_DISCRIMINATOR: u8 = 2;

let data = account.try_borrow_data()?;
if data[0] != VAULT_DISCRIMINATOR {
    return Err(MyError::InvalidAccountType.into());
}
```
- Without discriminators, an attacker can pass a `UserAccount` where a `VaultAccount` is expected if they have the same shape.
- If discriminators/tags do not exist yet, add them before relying on deserialization for security checks.

### 1.5 Key Check (for Fixed Accounts)
```rust
if clock_sysvar.key != &sysvar::clock::ID {
    return Err(ProgramError::InvalidArgument);
}
```
- Hardcode expected pubkeys for all fixed accounts: sysvars, known program IDs, config accounts.
- Never trust position alone to identify a fixed account.
- For System Program CPIs, always assert:
```rust
if system_program.key != &system_program::ID {
    return Err(ProgramError::InvalidArgument);
}
```
- Do this before constructing or invoking any `system_instruction::*` CPI.

---

## 2. DESERIALIZATION

### 2.1 Use `try_from_slice` — Never Assume Layout
```rust
let vault = Vault::try_from_slice(&account.data.borrow())?;
```
- Always use Borsh deserialization (`try_from_slice`) rather than manual byte casting.
- Manual byte casting with transmutes or raw pointer reads is undefined behavior territory.

### 2.2 Verify Data Length Before Deserializing
```rust
if account.data_len() < Vault::LEN {
    return Err(ProgramError::InvalidAccountData);
}
```
- An undersized account will panic or misread data during deserialization.
- Define a `LEN` constant for every struct.

### 2.3 Borrow Data Carefully
```rust
let data = account.try_borrow_data()?;   // immutable borrow for reading
let mut data = account.try_borrow_mut_data()?;  // mutable borrow for writing
```
- Never hold both a mutable and immutable borrow of the same account simultaneously — this will panic at runtime.
- Drop borrows before taking new ones on the same account.
- In instruction handlers, prefer `try_borrow_data()` / `try_borrow_mut_data()` over raw `borrow()` / `borrow_mut()` so failed borrow returns custom error instead of panicking.

---

## 3. PDA DERIVATION — NATIVE RUST

### 3.1 Find and Store Canonical Bump at Init Time
- On initialization, derive the expected PDA on-chain and verify the client-supplied account matches it before creating or writing any state.
```rust
// At initialization
let (vault_pda, bump) = Pubkey::find_program_address(
    &[b"vault", user.key.as_ref()],
    program_id,
);

// Verify the passed-in vault account matches the derived PDA
if vault_pda != *vault.key {
    return Err(ProgramError::InvalidArgument);
}

// Store bump in account data
vault_state.bump = bump;
```

### 3.2 Re-derivation on Subsequent Calls (Use Stored Bump)
```rust
// On subsequent instructions, use the stored bump — don't re-find it
let expected_vault = Pubkey::create_program_address(
    &[b"vault", user.key.as_ref(), &[vault_state.bump]],
    program_id,
)?;

if expected_vault != *vault.key {
    return Err(ProgramError::InvalidArgument);
}
```
- `create_program_address` is cheaper than `find_program_address` (no iteration).
- Never allow the user to supply a bump — they must use the one you stored.

### 3.3 Verify PDA is not a Signer Unless Expected
- PDAs cannot sign transactions initiated externally. If you receive a PDA that claims `is_signer = true` in a user-submitted transaction, something is wrong — reject it.

---

## 4. CPI IN NATIVE RUST

### 4.1 invoke — For Non-PDA-Signed CPIs
```rust
if system_program.key != &system_program::ID {
    return Err(ProgramError::InvalidArgument);
}

invoke(
    &system_instruction::transfer(from.key, to.key, lamports),
    &[from.clone(), to.clone(), system_program.clone()],
)?;
```
- Pass only the accounts the callee needs — nothing more.
- Always verify the callee's program ID before calling: `if callee_program.key != &expected_program::ID { ... }`.

### 4.2 invoke_signed — For PDA-Signed CPIs
```rust
let seeds = &[b"vault", user.key.as_ref(), &[vault_state.bump]];
invoke_signed(
    &instruction,
    &[account_a.clone(), account_b.clone()],
    &[seeds],
)?;
```
- Only use `invoke_signed` when your PDA must authorize the CPI.
- The seeds you provide must exactly match the PDA's derivation — any mismatch causes a runtime error.
- Never elevate non-signer accounts to signer status through `invoke_signed`.

### 4.3 Post-CPI Account Data Refresh
```rust
// CPI may have modified vault — refresh data manually
let vault_data = vault.try_borrow_data()?;
let updated_vault = Vault::try_from_slice(&vault_data)?;
```
- Unlike Anchor's `.reload()`, in native Rust you must manually re-borrow and re-deserialize the account data after a CPI.
- Never use a local variable that was deserialized before the CPI to make decisions after the CPI.
- After CPI, any cached assumptions about externally touched accounts may be stale. Re-read data and revalidate any invariants you still depend on before continuing.

---

## 5. ACCOUNT CREATION & RENT

### 5.1 Creating Accounts via System Program CPI
```rust
let rent = Rent::get()?;
let lamports = rent.minimum_balance(Vault::LEN);

invoke(
    &system_instruction::create_account(
        payer.key,
        new_account.key,
        lamports,
        Vault::LEN as u64,
        program_id,  // owner = your program
    ),
    &[payer.clone(), new_account.clone(), system_program.clone()],
)?;
```
- Always fund with `rent.minimum_balance(size)` — never a hardcoded lamport value.
- Set `owner = program_id` immediately — the System Program creates the account, your program owns the data.

### 5.2 Pre-allocated Accounts (User-Created Externally)
- If a user pre-creates the account before calling your instruction, verify:
  1. `account.owner == program_id` (after `create_account`, it should be)
  2. `account.data_len() >= expected_len`
  3. `account.lamports() >= rent.minimum_balance(account.data_len())`
  4. Data is all zeros (not previously initialized)

---

## 6. ACCOUNT CLOSING — NATIVE RUST

Proper close sequence — never skip any step:

```rust
// Step 1: Transfer lamports to recipient
let dest_lamports = recipient.lamports();
**recipient.lamports.borrow_mut() = dest_lamports
    .checked_add(account_to_close.lamports())
    .ok_or(MyError::Overflow)?;
**account_to_close.lamports.borrow_mut() = 0;

// Step 3: Assign ownership back to System Program
account_to_close.assign(&system_program::ID);

// Step 4: Realloc to 0 data len
info.realloc(0, false)?;
```

- Skipping step 1 (zero lamports) recover all the lamports that were deposited for rent or other purposes
- Skipping step 2 (reassigning owner) means your program still "owns" a zero-balance account, wasting space.
- Skipping step 3 (realloc) we must realloc to zero bytes otherwise rent must be deposited
- The recipient must be a trusted address — never arbitrary user-supplied.

## 7. ERROR HANDLING

### 7.1 Define a Custom Error Enum
```rust
use thiserror::Error;
use solana_program::program_error::ProgramError;

#[derive(Debug, Error)]
pub enum MyError {
    #[error("Authority mismatch")]
    AuthorityMismatch,
    #[error("Insufficient vault balance")]
    InsufficientBalance,
    #[error("Account already initialized")]
    AlreadyInitialized,
    #[error("Invalid account discriminator")]
    InvalidAccountType,
    #[error("Arithmetic overflow")]
    Overflow,
}

impl From<MyError> for ProgramError {
    fn from(e: MyError) -> Self {
        ProgramError::Custom(e as u32)
    }
}
```

- Every error must have a descriptive message — `Custom(0)` is meaningless to an auditor or debugger.
- Use `?` with `map_err` to convert errors cleanly: `.ok_or(MyError::Overflow)?`.

### 7.2 Never Panic in Production Code
- `unwrap()` and `expect()` are banned in instruction handlers — they crash the entire program.
- Use `?`, `ok_or()`, `unwrap_or_else()`, or explicit match patterns everywhere.

### 7.3 Logging Discipline
- Logging raw account metadata is useful for learning and debugging, but production code should avoid leaking unnecessary operational details.
- Keep logs minimal, purposeful, and safe to expose in public transaction traces.

---

## 8. INSTRUCTION PARSING

### 8.1 Deserialize Instruction Data Safely
```rust
#[derive(BorshDeserialize)]
pub struct TransferArgs {
    pub amount: u64,
    pub min_expected: u64,
}

let args = TransferArgs::try_from_slice(instruction_data)
    .map_err(|_| ProgramError::InvalidInstructionData)?;
```

### 8.2 Validate All Instruction Arguments
- After parsing, validate all fields: ranges, non-zero requirements, flag combinations.
- `amount == 0` should be explicitly rejected if not meaningful.
- Never trust instruction data — it's user-supplied and can be anything.

---

## 9. NATIVE RUST SECURITY CHECKLIST (Quick Reference)

Before submitting any instruction handler for review, verify:

- [ ] Owner check on every data account before deserialization
- [ ] Signer check on every authority account  
- [ ] Discriminator check on every deserialized account
- [ ] Foreign-program accounts validate type tag/discriminator
- [ ] Key check on every fixed/known account (sysvars, programs)
- [ ] Duplicate mutable account check between any two mutable accounts
- [ ] Canonical bump stored at init, reused on subsequent calls
- [ ] `try_from_slice` used for all deserialization (no raw byte casting)
- [ ] Data length verified before deserialization
- [ ] Account data borrows use `try_borrow_data` / `try_borrow_mut_data`
- [ ] No `unwrap()` or `expect()` in instruction handlers
- [ ] Checked arithmetic on all financial math
- [ ] CPI callee program ID verified before invoke
- [ ] `system_program.key == &system_program::ID` enforced before any System Program CPI
- [ ] Account data re-read after every CPI
- [ ] Account close performs: zero data → transfer lamports → assign to system program
- [ ] New accounts funded with `rent.minimum_balance(size)`, not hardcoded lamports
- [ ] Initialization guard (check data is zeroed / flag is false before init)

## 10. COMMON NATIVE BUILD & TOOLING ERRORS

### `cargo build-sbf` Not Found
Solana CLI not installed or not on PATH.
**Fix:** `sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.anza.xyz/stable/install)"` then add to PATH:
`export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"`

### `cargo build-bpf` Deprecation Warning
Expected — BPF is deprecated in favor of SBF. Use `cargo build-sbf`. Anchor 0.30+ handles this automatically.

### Platform Tools Corruption After Install
```
[ERROR] The Solana toolchain is corrupted. Run cargo-build-sbf with --force-tools-install
```
Caused by insufficient disk space during platform-tools extraction (~2 GB needed).
**Fix:** `cargo build-sbf --force-tools-install`. If root partition is small, symlink `~/.cache/solana/` to a larger disk.

### `feature edition2024 is required` (Cargo 1.84 / platform-tools v1.48)
Platform-tools v1.48 bundles `cargo 1.84.0` which does not support `edition = "2024"`. Pin known breaking crates:
```bash
cargo generate-lockfile
cargo update -p blake3          --precise 1.8.2
cargo update -p constant_time_eq --precise 0.3.1
cargo update -p base64ct        --precise 1.7.3
cargo update -p indexmap        --precise 2.11.4
```
**Always commit `Cargo.lock`** — this is the single most effective prevention.

### `No space left on device`
Solana CLI + platform tools need 2–5 GB. Clean old versions:
```bash
rm -rf ~/.local/share/solana/install/releases/<old_version>/
rm -rf ~/.cache/solana/
```

### `agave-install not found`
Anchor 0.31+ migrates to `agave-install` for Solana ≥1.18.19.
**Fix:** Install via `sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.anza.xyz/stable/install)"`.

### `solana-test-validator` Crashes or Hangs
```bash
pkill -f solana-test-validator && rm -rf test-ledger/
```
Check ports: `lsof -i :8899`. Consider **Surfpool** as a modern alternative.

### LiteSVM `undefined symbol: __isoc23_strtol`
LiteSVM 0.5.0 npm binary requires GLIBC ≥2.38. On Debian 12 / Ubuntu 22.04 (GLIBC 2.36) it fails.
**Fix:** Use `solana-bankrun` instead — verified working on GLIBC 2.36:
```bash
pnpm remove litesvm anchor-litesvm
pnpm add -D solana-bankrun anchor-bankrun
```
